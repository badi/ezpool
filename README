ABOUT
=====

This is a simple interface to python's multiprocessing.Pool to map functions over data
Default behavior is to use a single processor, identical to using itertools.imap.
In the case of multiple processors (specified using ez.pool.setup_pool), computations are farmed out to other processes using the multiprocessing library.

EXAMPLE
=======

  import ezpool

  nprocs = 42
  ezpool.setup_pool(nprocs)

  def fn(x): return x*82
  data = range(99)
  results = ezpool.map(fn, data)
